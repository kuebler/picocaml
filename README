Compile:

  1. Adjust Makefile
  2. Issue 'make'
  3. If no errors occur, a OCaml toplevel interactive interpreter picocaml
     should have been built in the project directory; start it via './picocaml'

NOTICE: This code is portable in the sense that it works on my box. If you 
experience any difficulties, feel free to adjust the code to suit your 
particular needs.
